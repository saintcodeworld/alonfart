# Cats Ass 3D Model Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Cats Ass 3D model for the game. The previous models have been completely removed and replaced with the Cats Ass model.

## Step 1: Cats Ass Model is Already Setup

The Cats Ass model has already been downloaded and placed in the game assets directory as `cats_ass (1).glb`.

## Step 2: Launch the Game

1. Open the game in your browser

2. You should now see the Cats Ass model, replacing the previous models

3. Click on the Cats Ass model to mine tokens just like you would with the original cube

## Model Features

- The model is rotated 90 degrees to show the back side
- Automatic scaling and positioning for optimal viewing
- Animation support (if available in the GLB file)
- Orange cat-themed placeholder if model fails to load

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the Cats Ass model or see a simplified cat placeholder figure:

1. Check that the model file is correctly named `cats_ass (1).glb` (case-sensitive)
2. Verify that the file is placed in the correct directory: `/assets/cats_ass (1).glb`
3. Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console) to check for any error messages
4. Try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the page

## Notes

- The model includes animations which will play automatically if available
- The mining functionality works exactly the same as before
- Click on the Cats Ass model to mine tokens!
- Previous models have been completely removed from the game
- If the Cats Ass model fails to load, a simplified cat figure will appear instead
