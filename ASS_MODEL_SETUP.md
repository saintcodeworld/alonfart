# Ass 3D Model Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Ass 3D model for the game. The Trump model has been completely removed and replaced with the Ass model.

## Step 1: Ass Model is Already Setup

The Ass model has already been downloaded and placed in the game assets directory as `ass_model.fbx`.

## Step 2: Launch the Game

1. Open the game in your browser

2. You should now see the Ass model, replacing the original Trump model

3. Click on the Ass model to mine tokens just like you would with the original cube

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the Ass model or see a simplified placeholder figure:

1. Check that the model file is correctly named `ass_model.fbx` (case-sensitive)
2. Verify that the file is placed in the correct directory: `/assets/ass_model.fbx`
3. Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console) to check for any error messages
4. Try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the page

## Notes

- The model includes animations which will play automatically if available
- The mining functionality works exactly the same as before
- Click on the Ass model to mine tokens!
- The Trump model has been completely removed from the game
- If the Ass model fails to load, a simplified Ass figure will appear instead
